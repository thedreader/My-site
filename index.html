      <h2 class="hello">Hello,</h2>
      <p class="bio">My name is Chirantan Paul and I'm a boy of age 19 and recently I started to take interest in web development. The internet really fascinates me and how we can develop websites and run it on the internet, where people from around the world can visit and know about someone's work or about someone from that website.</p>
